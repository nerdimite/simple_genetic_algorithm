# Simple Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithm in an Evolutionary Algorithm which is inspired by the biological process of Natural Selection where the fittest individuals survive and are replicated/reproduced/mutated in the next generation to produce a better set of individuals which hopefully solve the problem eventually. This repository contains the code for implementing Genetic Algorithms in plain python to solve the travelling salesman problem.

The blog associated with this code can be read [here](https://medium.com/gradientfire/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-58263747b9a0). Do give it a read and let me know your feedback.
