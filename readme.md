# Simple Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithm in an Evolutionary Algorithm which is inspired by the biological process of Natural Selection where the fittest individuals survive and are replicated/reproduced/mutated in the next generation to produce a better set of individuals which hopefully solve the problem eventually.

This repository contains the code for the first part of the webinar series I am doing on Evolutionary AI. In this session, I demonstrate the basics of Genetic Algorithm by writing the GA from scratch in Python to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem.
